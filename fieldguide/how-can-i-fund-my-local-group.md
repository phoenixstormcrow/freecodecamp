# How can I fund my local group?

Let's face it, organizing a local group of Free Code Campers can be a challenge, particularly when it comes to covering the costs involved. Maybe you want to schedule an all-night hackathon, and need to rent venue space, or want to bring a stack of pizzas to your next meetup. As a local group leader, you have plenty of options for obtaining these resources, while remaining true to the idea that [Free Code Camp should be free for all Campers](http://www.freecodecamp.com/field-guide/if-free-code-camp-is-free,-how-does-it-make-money).

- Talk to local venue owners and administrators. Local schools, community colleges, universities, public libraries, and coffee shops are all great settings for meetups, and many of them will be happy to donate space to not-for-profit initiatives.

- Crowdfunding. Is there an event or conference you'd like to attend with your group? Sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo do a great job of putting your fundraising campaign in front of the eyes of potential donors. Of course, you can always take up a collection in your community as well!

- Approach potential sponsors. There may be local businesses in your community that would be glad to sponsor your group! This is how many youth sports teams get funded, after all. Local businesses are often happy to donate goods in exchange for advertising opportunities, so get out there and network!

- Make a product or service. We're here at Free Code Camp to learn how to make awesome web applications, and turn those skills into a lucrative career. Think of ways your group can leverage those skills to provide value to your community. Maybe the local pizza parlour needs a new website, or a maybe the shuttle bus company that could take your group to it's next conference needs a scheduling app.

This list only scratches the surface; use your creativity and your local network to find the opportunities in your area. Got a suggestion for the list? Let us know by [contributing to the field guide!](http://www.freecodecamp.com/field-guide/how-can-i-contribute-to-this-guide).
